Today, I was asked an interview question: What's the difference between signed and unsigned integers? I knew the answer had to do with representing numbers differently, but I wasn't able to give the concise answer I wanted. 

The difference exists in how you represent binary numbers

Unsigned -> Only Positive Numbers
Signed   -> Positive and Negative Numbers
