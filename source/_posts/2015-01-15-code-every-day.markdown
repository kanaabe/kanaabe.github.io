Starting 2015, I wanted to write code every day. This meant making at least one meaningful open-source commit each day. It was inspired by John Resig in [this post](http://ejohn.org/blog/write-code-every-day/). All was going well, I felt confident, and submitted good code.

And then I broke it on January 3.

Just 6 days in (I started December 28) and I couldn't keep up with my grand plan. Needless to say I was embarrassed and thought this would be impossible. Well, it is. I mean it's *possible* to write code every day for the rest of your life but in a realistic life-setting, mistakes happen, life happens. **You can't expect to form a concrete habit in one shot**. 

Just keep swimming. All I can ask of myself is that the next time I break the streak, it better be longer than 6 days and it *better* be for a good reason. My current streak is 12 days and I'm feeling pretty happy. In fact, I'm really proud of all the work that's been done in just 12 days. 

I finished a game, I updated the look and feel of this blog, fixed a bunch of bugs that bothered me, started re-designing my boyfriend's portfolio site, and today I dug up my legacy portfolio site and started cleaning. *Oh, cleaning.* What a wonderful feeling to see terribly designed code and start cleaning.

One fear that's been coming up a lot is: what's going to happen when I start a new job? Ideally I'll be writing code every day at my job, but what about the weekends? Will I be too tired? What if my job doesn't have open-sourced projects? Look, I didn't sign a contract to do this - I'm doing this to be a better coder. Right now, this is the best way I can think of to do that. **It doesn't have to be forever, but it should be consistent for as long as it matters**. 

I've been trying at this habit for about a month now and it's been a very therapeutic experience. I get excited to open up my computer and pick up where I left things, still fresh. I don't plan on stopping when I start a new job because I'm feeling a lot of the positive side-effects that John Resig talks about in his post. I can't wait to hit that 1 year streak. It will happen, and it will happen naturally!
