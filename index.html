  <h2><a href="/blog/2015/01/15/code-every-day/">Code Every Day</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>Starting 2015, I wanted to write code every day. This meant making at least one meaningful open-source commit each day. It was inspired by John Resig in <a href="http://ejohn.org/blog/write-code-every-day/">this post</a>. All was going well, I felt confident, and submitted good code.</p>




<p>And then I broke it on January 3.</p>




<p>Just 6 days in (I started December 28) and I couldn&rsquo;t keep up with my grand plan. Needless to say I was embarrassed and thought this would be impossible. Well, it is. I mean it&rsquo;s <em>possible</em> to write code every day for the rest of your life but in a realistic life-setting, mistakes happen, life happens. <strong>You can&rsquo;t expect to form a concrete habit in one shot</strong>.</p>




<p>Just keep swimming. All I can ask of myself is that the next time I break the streak, it better be longer than 6 days and it <em>better</em> be for a good reason. My current streak is 12 days and I&rsquo;m feeling pretty happy. In fact, I&rsquo;m really proud of all the work that&rsquo;s been done in just 12 days.</p>




<p>I finished a game, I updated the look and feel of this blog, fixed a bunch of bugs that bothered me, started re-designing my boyfriend&rsquo;s portfolio site, and today I dug up my legacy portfolio site and started cleaning. <em>Oh, cleaning.</em> What a wonderful feeling to see terribly designed code and start cleaning.</p>




<p>One fear that&rsquo;s been coming up a lot is: what&rsquo;s going to happen when I start a new job? Ideally I&rsquo;ll be writing code every day at my job, but what about the weekends? Will I be too tired? What if my job doesn&rsquo;t have open-sourced projects? Look, I didn&rsquo;t sign a contract to do this - I&rsquo;m doing this to be a better coder. Right now, this is the best way I can think of to do that. <strong>It doesn&rsquo;t have to be forever, but it should be consistent for as long as it matters</strong>.</p>




<p>I&rsquo;ve been trying at this habit for about a month now and it&rsquo;s been a very therapeutic experience. I get excited to open up my computer and pick up where I left things, still fresh. I don&rsquo;t plan on stopping when I start a new job because I&rsquo;m feeling a lot of the positive side-effects that John Resig talks about in his post. I can&rsquo;t wait to hit that 1 year streak. It will happen, and it will happen naturally!</p>

    <p>Getting Started With SVG</p>




<p>Everyone seems to have at least some interest in data visualization lately. It’s pretty, it’s informative, and it makes us feel like we’re learning something without reading long lines of text. One of the most popular Javascript libraries for creating data visualizations are with D3.js.</p>




<p>D3 is built on top of these common standards:</p>




<ol>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>The DOM</li>
<li>SVG</li>
</ol>




<p>Before starting D3, we should be somewhat familiar with the concepts above. I’m pretty familiar with 1-3, so today I’m writing about.. SVG</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2014/10/16/the-nokogiri-saw/">The Nokogiri Saw</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>In Japanese, the term “nokogiri” refers to this:</p>




<p><img src="http://hsto.org/storage/habraeffect/11/8d/118d003d546a1fa1e240e1cc4dfb4a61.jpg" alt="Nokogiri Saw" /></p>




<p>It’s a saw used for cutting wood, but instead of making the cut on the “push” like a traditional European saw, the Nokogiri saw cuts on the “pull”.
Coming from a small <a href="sites.google.com/site/digihumanlab/research">background</a> in Data Science, my brain lit up as soon as I was introduced to this magical gem.</p>




<h2>Define the Problem</h2>




<p>After explaining to my boyfriend the concept of ‘scraping’, I asked him, “What do you want me to scrape for you?”
“I want to know how to title my Reddit posts so it catches the most attention.”
Great, problem defined.</p>
