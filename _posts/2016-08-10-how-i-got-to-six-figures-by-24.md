In 2009, when I was a 19 year old freshman, I saw Ed Catmull speak at UC Santa Cruz. Afterwards, I waited in line to talk to Ed and told him I wanted to work in R&D at Pixar. I asked him what I should major in with that end goal in mind. He said, Art and Computer Science, so I did exactly that.

My sophomore year I transferred to Rutgers University in New Jersey, my hometown, because out-of-state tuition was becoming more like out-of-hand tuition. Anyway, my education at Rutgers was great and I loved the duality of art and science nerds. I had friends in both of those classes, but there was never any overlap. Mostly I was pretty depressed from the transfer, was trying to hold on to a long-term relationship, and a childhood friend who attended Rutgers with me had passed away that year as well.

As a junior, I took Intro to Computer Graphics and I didn't love it. I also took Imaging and Multimedia and I loved it. I remember being completely fascinated at how simple it was to apply a filter to an image based on image kernels. Since I was interested in R&D, I asked that professor if I could work on any research in the Computer Vision department. I told him I'd get back to him with an idea. My contemporary art history classes were structured linearlly. Monet's Impressionist style influenced Van Gogh and Post-Impressionism, which catapulted Cubism, Expressionism, and Dadaism, which projected Dali and Surrealism, etc etc. I propsed the idea that maybe computers could do all this work.

My senior year, I started working a lot on this research topic, and started to break down what elements of an artwork art historians might look at to determine where the influences might be hiding. It turns out that categorization of artwork is pretty important. To be able to determine what influences a painting, we should be able to categorize it first. Since art history is written by humans and is subjective anyway, I didn't see much of a difference. I can tell this is already getting a little too detailed, so I'll move on.

The paper turned out to be pretty popular and people around the Internet wrote about it including the Sunday edition of The Washington Post. On the arts side, I did a few Arduino projects and started a magazine called Trim with a friend. It was the complete opposite of the stuff I was doing in the CBIM labs. We were organizing photo shoots, contacting models, and trying to get people to everything for free. It was hard. There were a lot of late nights.

Overall my senior year was the most stressed I had ever been. I had to plan out every minute of my life including when I would have time to grab a bite, and if I should bring a toothbrush in case I pull an all-nighter in the library. I had a part-time job, the research project, TRIM magazine, social life, and I was trying to complete an intensive double major in three years. All my guidance counselors said I couldn't do it but I did.

After I graduated I took a month-long backpacking trip to Thailand and Cambodia with some friends. What a time that was. The friends I was travelling with all went to business school and had jobs lined up except for me. This is kind of where Artsy came in.
