** Disclaimer: I will not talk about money in this post.

In 2009, when I was a 19 year old freshman, I saw Ed Catmull speak at UC Santa Cruz. Afterwards, I waited in line to talk to Ed and told him I wanted to do R&D at Pixar. I asked him what I should major in with that goal in mind. He said, Art and Computer Science, so I did exactly that.

### College

My sophomore year I transferred to Rutgers University in New Jersey, my homestate, because out-of-state tuition was getting out-of-hand. That sophomore year was hard, though. I was severely depressed after the transfer because I was trying to hold onto a long-term relationship that tore me apart. My close friend Goh had committed suicide that year as well. We were both new to Rutgers (himself a freshman) and we often used to talk about jazz, relationships, and life. One enjoyable thing about that year was discovering the duality of being around art and science nerds, even though there was never any overlap.

As a junior, I took Intro to Computer Graphics and I didn't love it, which was a let down considering I wanted to be in Computer Animation. However, I also took Imaging and Multimedia and that, I loved. I remember my fascination at how simple it was to apply a filter to an image based on image kernels. Since I was interested in R&D, I asked that professor if I could work on any research in the Computer Vision department. I told him I would get back to him with an idea for a paper. On the flip side, I noticed a pattern in my art history classes: they were all structured linearlly. Monet's Impressionist style influenced Van Gogh and Post-Impressionism, which catapulted Cubism, Expressionism, and Dadaism, which projected Dali and Surrealism, etc etc. I propsed to Professor Elgammal the idea that maybe computers could do all this work and discover even more.

My senior year, I started working a lot on this research topic, and started to break down what elements of an artwork art historians might look at to determine where the influences might be hiding. It turns out that categorization of artwork is pretty important. To be able to determine what influences a painting, we should be able to categorize it first. Since art history is written by humans and is subjective anyway, I didn't see why computers couldn't try it.

The paper turned out to be pretty popular and people around the Internet wrote about it including the Sunday edition of The Washington Post. You can read more about it [here](https://sites.google.com/site/digihumanlab/research/artistic-influence)

In my art classes, I did a few Arduino projects and started a magazine called Trim with a friend. It was the complete opposite of the stuff I was doing in the CBIM labs. We were organizing photo shoots, contacting models, and trying to get people to everything for free. It was hard and there were a lot of late nights.

Overall my senior year was the most stressed I had ever been. I had to plan out every minute of my life including when I would have time to grab a bite, and if I should bring a toothbrush in case I pull an all-nighter in the library. I had a part-time job, the research project, TRIM magazine, social life, and I was trying to complete an intensive double major in three years. All my guidance counselors said I couldn't do it but I did.

### Sailthru

After I graduated I took a month-long backpacking trip to Thailand and Cambodia with some friends. What a time that was! The friends I was travelling with all went to business school and had jobs lined up except for me. I ended up accepting a job at Sailthru while in Thailand, for better or for worse, as a Support Engineer in their Client Services team.

This job was nothing like I had expected. Everyday my job was the same. Pick up new tickets, email people back about their technical issues, and man the phone. About once a week I would be on call, which meant that I would have to answer client calls at 6AM if someone felt so inclined to set up a data feed as the sun rose. Corporate life there was fine -- there were a fair amount of alcoholics and basic ladies but everyone was more or less friendly. I did get to do some technical things like set up complex templating conditionals and help people understand the API and data feeds. Whatever, it was a good introduction to the tech industry.

I got pretty tired of this job quickly, but I managed to stay a whole year. In the last months before I left were some dark times at Sailthru. Shit was just breaking everywhere -- it was the curse of Robin Williams. After his death all our machines broke and the number of tickets spiked exponentially. We were struggling so hard and I remember feeling like there would be no end. At this point I felt like I paid my debt. I felt like I deserved more. So I left a month later.

The most applicable thing I learned was to treat your co-workers like you do your clients. I also confirmed that I wanted to be an engineer more than anything.

### The Flatiron School

The path I desperately wanted to take was that of a software engineer at a company that involved art and that I cared for and believed in. It led me to The Flatiron School. What a wonderful place that was, and a great reset to my life. Fresh sneakers, new people, the lowest block on Broadway, and a topic that I enjoy. I echo these [thoughts](https://www.quora.com/What-is-your-review-of-Flatiron-School) about FIS and I'll always be proud to say where I came from. Funny enough, all those Discrete Math and Linear Algebra classes in college really didn't do shit for me. Sure I was invested at the time, but I didn't come out of there feeling prepped for a software engineering job like I did out of FIS.

### Artsy

My first choice company to work for was Artsy, since college. I asked Professor Elgammal if there are companies out there that do Art and Science. He said yes, look at Artsy! I was in love. Thanks to the conneX at FIS, I got to interview at Artsy. I remember going up to the 25th floor for the first time and thinking, "This feels like heaven". No joke, I was so enamored. The next thing I knew I was deploying to production.

It's been a long journey since, and 1.5 years have passed since I started. In the beginnings I was a contributor to artsy.net and m.artsy.net, picked up issues, and deployed containable features. Craig then introduced me to Writer, a backend CMS for publishing articles all strapped with it's own API, database, and shiny React front-end. Eventually I took over it. Over the course of a year, Editorial grew tremendously in popularity, so a product team called Publishing was created.

We've done a lot of cool features since, like this [Year in Art](https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-2015-the-year-in-art) package, this [UBS Series](https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-how-art-fairs-expanded-the-contemporary-art-market) about the art market, and [my biggest PR yet](https://github.com/artsy/positron/pull/772) to name a few.

I'm the solo engineer on this team, soon to be joined by an intern. I'm currently trying to prepare for the new challenges of managing someone, while seeking new things to learn, like VR.

That's it for now!
